## About this game
An annual trip to the famous MineCon Convention turns out to be a horrific suprise.

You play as Sophie, a MineCon enthusiast who is thrilled to bring her friends for the first to enjoy the convention with her. During the convention, Sophie is seperated from her friends, as a building lockdown emerged. Sophie is challenged to a puzzling quest with her friends' life at stake, hoping to rescue them and return home.

Enter the Haunted Hopper Hotel and explore a world filled with strange and terrifying creatures and dolls. Gather your friends and keys, and escape this spine-chilling MinCon.
